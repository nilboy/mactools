##Reset Mac wifi configure
We often encounter such problem that mac can't connect wifi. It's usually caused by wrong network configure.I make a small shell program to fix the problem.You can get the tiny program from [here](https://github.com/nilboy/mactools/blob/master/src/restet_wifi.sh)

You can run as below.

	chmod 755 reset_wifi.sh
	./reset_wifi.sh
	rm -rf ~/tmp      #(optional, recommended)
